Text Generation with LSTM

This project implements a text generation model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to generate new text based on literary styles. It supports both character-level and word-level generation modes.

Dataset
The project uses 5 classic text files from the NLTK Gutenberg corpus as the dataset:
austen-emma.txt
, austen-persuasion.txt
, austen-sense.txt
, shakespeare-hamlet.txt
, bible-kjv.txt
